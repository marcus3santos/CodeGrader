#+Title: Common Lisp Practicum Test

* Questions

** Question 1

*NOTE*:
- You are required to write the solutions for the parts of this question in the Lisp program file *~/PT/q1.lisp*
- You must not use or refer to the following Lisp built-in functions and symbols: COUNT, MEMBER, . The penalty for doing so is a deduction of 80% on the score of your solutions for this question.
 

**Part 1:** Write a function =count-occurrences= that takes an element
and a list as arguments and returns the number of times the element
appears in the list. 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
CL-USER> (COUNT-OCCURRENCES 3 '(1 2 3 3 3 4))
3
CL-USER> (COUNT-OCCURRENCES 'A '(A B A C A))
3
CL-USER> (COUNT-OCCURRENCES 5 '(1 2 3 4))
0
#+END_EXAMPLE

# Test cases
**Part 2:** Write a function =contains-all?= that takes two lists as
arguments and returns =T= if all elements of the first list are
contained in the second list, and =NIL= otherwise.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
CL-USER> (CONTAINS-ALL? '(1 2) '(1 2 3 4))
T
CL-USER> (CONTAINS-ALL? '(1 5) '(1 2 3 4))
NIL
CL-USER> (CONTAINS-ALL? 'NIL '(1 2 3))
T
#+END_EXAMPLE

# Test cases

** Question 2

*NOTE*:
- You are required to write the solutions for the parts of this question in the Lisp program file *~/PT/q2.lisp*
- You must not use or refer to the following Lisp built-in functions and symbols: REVERSE, NREVERSE, . The penalty for doing so is a deduction of 80% on the score of your solutions for this question.

**Part 1:** Write a function =reverse-list= that takes a list as an
argument and returns a new list that is the reverse of the original
list. 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
CL-USER> (REVERSE-LIST '(1 2 3 4))
'(4 3 2 1)
CL-USER> (REVERSE-LIST '(A B C))
'(C B A)
CL-USER> (REVERSE-LIST 'NIL)
'NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

# Test cases

**Part 2:** Write a function =palindrome?= that takes a list as an
argument and returns =T= if the list is a palindrome (reads the same
forwards and backwards), and =NIL= otherwise. You may not use
=REVERSE= or =NREVERSE=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
CL-USER> (PALINDROME? '(1 2 3 2 1))
T
CL-USER> (PALINDROME? '(A B C D))
NIL
CL-USER> (PALINDROME? 'NIL)
T
#+END_EXAMPLE
